        <h1>Long-Distance Love</h1>
        <p>My beloved,</p>
        <p>Between the distance that separates us, I miss you more than words can express. Every day, every second, my thoughts are always with you. Even though we are separated by thousands of kilometers, my heart is always with you. I miss your smile, your laughter, and all the beautiful moments we have shared together.</p>
        <p>This distance may test us, but I believe our love is stronger than any obstacle that exists. When night falls and the stars shine, I often remember all the beautiful memories we shared, like when we walked hand in hand or spent time at our favorite places. All those moments make me even more certain that you are the right one for me.</p>
        <p>Every time we talk through messages or video calls, my heart flutters because I miss you. I long to feel your embrace and see the love in your eyes. My love for you is the compass that always guides me, giving me hope in every step I take. You are my reason to smile every day.</p>
        <p>I hope time flies so we can meet soon. I want to create more memories with you, celebrating our love that grows despite the distance. Until that time comes, I will continue to pray and wait patiently.</p>
        <p>Our love is a colorful journey, and I am so lucky to walk this path with you. Thank you for being a source of inspiration and happiness in my life.</p>
        <p>Always loving you, from afar or close.</p>
